# 🎓 The Effect of Optional Practical Training (OPT) on U.S. College Graduates

Hi there 👋 — this repository contains part of my **Job Market Paper**, where I explore how changes in the U.S. **OPT (Optional Practical Training)** program have shaped the labor market outcomes of both **foreign** and **domestic** college graduates.

Using large-scale data from the **Current Population Survey (CPS, 2000–2024)**, I analyze how the 2008 and 2016 OPT extensions affected:
- 🎯 **Occupation choice** — who enters STEM jobs, and when  
- 💰 **Wages** — how the earnings gap evolved between STEM and non-STEM workers  
- 🌍 **Differences by citizenship** — contrasting U.S. and international graduates

## 📊 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Trend of Occupation Choice and Wage.md` | Shows long-term trends in occupation composition and wage differentials between STEM and non-STEM fields. Includes visualizations for both domestic and foreign graduates. |
| `Trends of Majors.md` | Examines changes in the share of STEM degrees over time for bachelor’s and master’s graduates, by citizenship. Highlights how foreign STEM shares rose sharply after OPT extensions. |

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🧑‍🎓 **Foreign students** dramatically increased their share of STEM degrees after the 2016 OPT extension — especially at the master’s level.  
- 💼 **Domestic students** also moved slightly toward STEM fields, but much more gradually.  
- 📈 **Foreign STEM participation** and wages surged post-2016, while domestic trends remained stable.  
- 💬 Overall, OPT seems to have **strengthened incentives for foreign STEM specialization** without clear evidence of crowding out U.S. graduates.

## 🤓 Why This Matters

The OPT program is a cornerstone of U.S. immigration and education policy — it shapes how international students transition into the U.S. labor market.  
By combining **policy analysis**, **labor economics**, and **data visualization**, this project gives an empirical view of how migration policy affects real-world labor dynamics.
